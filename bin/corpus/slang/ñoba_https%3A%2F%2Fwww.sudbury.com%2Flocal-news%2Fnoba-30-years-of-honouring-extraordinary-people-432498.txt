In 1986, the province of Ontario decided to hold a conference to boost Northern Ontario's economy by bringing together businesspeople from the region at a conference.
They approached Northern Ontario Business — a publication started six years earlier with a focus on the achievements of businesses in the area — for help in putting together the event.
The conference, held in Sault Ste. Marie, included seminars, a gala dinner and awards given to some of the North's most prominent businesspeople. The awards program was an informal affair compared to what was to come.
Michael Atkins, president of both Northern Ontario Business and Northern Life, enjoyed the event so much he decided to do what he could to continue it in future years under his publishing company's banner.
The Northern Ontario Business Awards (NOBA) were presented in a much more formal way the following year, in 1987. The rest is history. The awards program celebrates its 30th anniversary at the Caruso Club in Sudbury tonight.
When asked what the milestone means to him, Atkins said he'll be thinking about all of the individuals who have won awards over the years, some of whom have since passed away.
“I am nostalgic for the people that are no longer with us,” Atkins said. “I'm nostalgic as I look through some of the winners and I remember some of their fabulous stories and the excitement.
“There are lots of people that I remember who were extraordinary people, and it was just a pleasure to meet them and have a drink with them, and cheer them on.”
There'll be banners set up throughout the venue featuring the photos of every NOBA winner over the past three decades. 
The commemorative magazine for this year's event will also have a pull-out section dedicated to the program's sponsors over the years.
When the NOBA started, business owners across the North didn't seem to know each other, and operated in silos, Atkins said. 
The awards program brought them together so they could network. Some businesspeople even brought their awards to the bank, and used them as proof of how good they are at what they do, and asked for loans to expand.
Atkins said he's observed a growth in the sophistication of these companies in the past 30 years. Now their markets aren't limited to the region or even the country — they're shipping internationally.
“I'm proud of what we've been able to do as a company to bring Northern Ontario together, to help animate the positives and the struggles,” Atkins said.
“I do feel thankful for being able to do it. We live in a country where we're free to do whatever you want. You're free to lose your money in whatever way you want, and you're free to create whatever you want.
“Like the great movie, if you create it, sometimes they will come. In this instance, they came, they continue to come, and it's great. We feel very proud about that.”
