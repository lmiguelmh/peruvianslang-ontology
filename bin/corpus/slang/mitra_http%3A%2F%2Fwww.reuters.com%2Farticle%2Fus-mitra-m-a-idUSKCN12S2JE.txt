The fund raise could be announced as early as Monday, the source said.

Founded in 2005, Mitra in involved in exploration and pre-development in the Philippines, Vietnam and Indonesia. It is based in Kuala Lumpur and its shares are listed in Toronto.
Mitra could use the money to help fund the previously announced acquisition of Stag Oilfield, in the Carnarvon Basin off Western Australia, the source said. Mitra could look to do more acquisitions in the Carnarvon Basin, the source said.
