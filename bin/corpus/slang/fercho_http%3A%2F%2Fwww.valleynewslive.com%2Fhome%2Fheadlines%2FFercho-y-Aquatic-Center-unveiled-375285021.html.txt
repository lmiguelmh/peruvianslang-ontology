It is a big day for the “Y” in downtown Fargo and the people who enjoy the pool there.
The "Y" is celebrating its new aquatic center with a ribbon cutting.
The six-million-dollar center is made-up of three pools.
There are now six lanes for swimming laps in one pool, and the lanes are now seven-feet side.
There's a zero-depth pool for babies and little kids and a warm water pool.
The "Y’s” aquatic director, Britt Selbo says this new facility has a little something for pretty much everyone.
She calls it a really great place to come and play.
"Y" members will be able to start using the pool Friday.
It'll be available to the public a week from Saturday, April 23rd.
