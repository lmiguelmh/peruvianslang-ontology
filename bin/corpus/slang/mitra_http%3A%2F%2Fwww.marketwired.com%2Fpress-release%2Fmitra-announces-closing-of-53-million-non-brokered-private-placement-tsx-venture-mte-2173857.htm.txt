Mitra Announces Closing of $53 Million Non-Brokered Private Placement
SINGAPORE, SINGAPORE--(Marketwired - Nov. 8, 2016) -
NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO U.S. NEWSWIRE SERVICES OF FOR DISSEMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES. ANY FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THIS RESTRICTION MAY CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF U.S. SECURITIES LAWS.
Mitra Energy Inc. (TSX VENTURE:MTE) ("Mitra" or the "Company") is pleased to announce that it has closed its previously announced non-brokered private placement (the "Private Placement"). The Company has issued a total of 132,500,000 common shares (each, a "Share") at a price per Share of C$0.40 for gross proceeds of C$53,000,000 (approximately US$40,000,000). Three of Mitra's existing major shareholders (the "Major Shareholders") purchased the majority of the Private Placement with a small portion purchased by some of the Company's directors and officers.
The proceeds of the Private Placement will be used to:
Fund the purchase of the Stag Oilfield (the "Stag Acquisition") by Jadestone Energy (Australia) Pty Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mitra,
Fund a bank guarantee or letter of credit to be provided to a key contractor to the Stag Oilfield in support of obligations under a long term contract, and
Provide the capital for further appraisal and infill drilling in the Stag field, as well as working capital.
The Company now anticipates closing the Stag Acquisition on November 10, 2016.
Immediately prior to the closing of the Private Placement, all of the issued and outstanding Class B common shares of the Company (the "Class B Shares") were converted into common shares of the Company by the holder thereof. As a result of the Private Placement and the conversion of the Class B Shares, the Company has an aggregate of 221,298,004 common shares issued and outstanding.
For further details regarding the Stag Acquisition and the Stag assets, please refer to the Company's press releases dated July 26, 2016, September 7, 2016 and October 7, 2016.
All of the Shares issued in the Private Placement are subject to a four month hold period expiring on March 8, 2017.
As the Major Shareholders and the directors of the Company are considered to be "related parties" of the Company, the issuance of the Shares pursuant to the Private Placement is considered to be a "related party transaction" under Multilateral Instrument 61-101 - Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions ("MI 61-101"). The Company has relied on the exemptions from the valuation and minority shareholder approval requirements of MI 61-101 contained in sections 5.5(b) and (e) and 5.7(c) of MI 61-101.
