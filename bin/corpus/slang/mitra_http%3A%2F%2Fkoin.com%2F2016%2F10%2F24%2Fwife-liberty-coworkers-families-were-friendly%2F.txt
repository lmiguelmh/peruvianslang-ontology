PPB: Possible link between coworkers’ shooting, suicide
PORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN) — Two families are devastated over the death of a mother and father in what could be a possible murder suicide between co-workers.
On Saturday evening, police found the body of Mitra Mehrabadi inside the Liberty Centre. Police report she had been shot multiple times.

At this point, investigators are trying to determine if the suicide Jimmy Alan Morgan is connected to Mehrabadi’s death.
Before police knew about Mehrabadi’s death, patrol officers found the body of Morgan several blocks away from the office center where the two worked together at Liberty Mutual Insurance.
On Monday, Diane Morgan spoke to KOIN 6 News from her Gresham residence. She said Jim was a “loving and devoted husband, father and neighbor.”
She confirmed that the two families were close and spent time together socially.
According to Diane Morgan, the families would host dinner parties at their residences.
“We had a great time,” she said as she described the time the families spent together.
KOIN 6 News has learned that Mehrabadi leaves behind a husband and 8-year-old daughter. Morgan leaves behind his wife and 17-year-old daughter.
Diane Morgan said she believes, based on what she has been told by police, that her husband is responsible for Mehrabadi’s death.
Police have not released specific information about their investigation, other than confirming they are investigating a possible link.
“He never seemed upset,” Diane Morgan said of her husband.

She said he left their residence around 8 a.m. Saturday and told her that he was going to a hardware store to looking a fencing material.
Diane Morgan said she had no indication that her husband was going to work, or that he was armed with the gun that he owns.
“He told me goodbye,” she said.
Diane Morgan said she and her husband had plans Saturday night.
According to police, Morgan and Mehrabadi worked together at Liberty Mutual Insurance. Diane Morgan said her husband was an insurance underwriter.
Liberty Mutual has not responded to multiple requests for comments on the death of its two employees.
Diane Morgan told KOIN 6 News that Mehrabadi and her husband immigrated to the United States from Iran, where Mehrabadi attended school.
She said her husband was “intrigued” about the Mehrabadi’s story of moving.
Diane Morgan said she did not know of any hostility between her husband and Mehrabadi.
Anyone with information about this case is asked to contact Detective Michele Michaels at 503-823-0692, michele.michaels@portlandoregon.gov; or, Detective Bryan Steed at 503-823-0395, bryan.steed@portlandoregon.gov.
