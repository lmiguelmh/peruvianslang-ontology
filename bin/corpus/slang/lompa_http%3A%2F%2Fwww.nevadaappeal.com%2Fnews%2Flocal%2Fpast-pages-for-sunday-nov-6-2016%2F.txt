150 YEARS AGO
Capturing ants: The following is the method for ridding kitchen and cupboards of pestiferous nuisances, ants: Get a large sponge, wash it and press it dry. Sprinkle over it some fine white sugar and place where the ants are most troublesome. They will soon collect on the sponge and make their home in the sponge cells. Then dip the sponge in scalding water. This will clear the house of every aunt, uncle and progeny.

Aladdin’s Lamp in Goldfield: Never before in mining history has there been a tale of suddenly acquired riches.

A tidal wave is the only adequate metaphor descriptive of these conditions.
