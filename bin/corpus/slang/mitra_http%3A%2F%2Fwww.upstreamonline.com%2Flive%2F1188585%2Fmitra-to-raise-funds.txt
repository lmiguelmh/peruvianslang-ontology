The non-brokered private placement will raise C$53 million (US$37.4 million) through the issue of 132.5 million shares at a price of C$0.40 per share.
The money raised in the placement will be used to fund Mitra’s US$10 million acquisition of the Stag oilfield off Western Australia, a bank guarantee or letter of credit for a key Stag contractor, as well as for further appraisal and infill drilling at the field.
The non-brokered placement will replace the brokered private placement announced last month.
Mitra also revealed it had entered into a US$28 million convertible debt facility with Tyrus Capital Event which will give it the ability to drawdown tranches of US$5 million, subject to Tyrus’ approval.
The company will use the facility to fund future mergers and acquisitions, other than Stag, and for capital expenditure on producing assets.
Under the facility, any amounts drawn down will bear interest at a rate of 7.5% per annum which will be payable quarterly in cash.
The facility will mature after three years, at which time Tyrus will have the option to convert the full amount of any principal owing into common shares in Mitra at a conversion price of C$0.50.
