Rock En Español Band La Sarita Slams Lima with Indigenous Soul
IN PICTURES: La Sarita celebrates the diversity of cultures in Peru while fusing their music with social commentary.
"La Sarita" is one of the most prominent and first bands to fuse rock with Indigenous Peruvian music. They debuted their latest album, "Homage to Peru," with a concert on Saturday. Their music seeks to integrate the different cultural aspects of Lima, a city of 10 million people, most of who are first- or second-generation immigrants from rural areas in the Andes and the Amazon. Their music celebrates the diversity of cultures interacting in the capital but their lyrics also attempt to bring depth into the lives of people in the city while criticizing corruption, chauvinism, and racism that has become normalized.
teleSUR takes a look at one of Peru's most popular bands performing onstage in their own hometown.
