The North Bay Badminton Team is back in full swing again this year.
Provincial level athletes have already competed at the Mandarin Jr B tournament over the Thanksgiving weekend.
On October 21-22, the Sudbury Junior Badminton Club hosted the first Northern Ontario Badminton Association (NOBA) tournament of the season.
The tournament drew over 100 athletes from Bracebridge, North Bay, Sudbury, Timmins and Elliot Lake.
The North Bay Badminton Team brought a contingent of 29 athletes to the tournament, across all age groups and events.

For many this was not only the first tournament of the season, but their first tournament as members of the North Bay Badminton Team. Head coach, Kurt Tempelmans Plat was satisfied with the weekend's results.
"This is the first big tournament of the year for many of the kids. It's a good warm-up and sets the bar for future events and really motivated a lot of the athletes to work even harder. I can't wait to see where this season takes us."

Tempelmans Plat also highlighted that 2 athletes from the team journeyed to the Haber Community Center in Burlington over the weekend of Oct 29-30 to participate in a Jr A provincial event (the highest level event for juniors in the province of Ontario).
Gabriel Pharand dropped his first match in singles 15-21, and 16-21 to the #5 seed; he then just missed out on a win in consolation, losing in 3 games.
Merret Jung, a foreign exchange student from Germany that is spending her time training with the North Bay Badminton Team during her exchange to Canada had a successful weekend.
Jung took home the bronze in singles and managed a fourth place finish in doubles. Both athletes played very well, and we look forward to supporting them at their next Jr A event.
The North Bay Badminton Team is always looking for new members, they have programs starting as of the age of 4, and their competitive teams begin as young as 9 years old.
