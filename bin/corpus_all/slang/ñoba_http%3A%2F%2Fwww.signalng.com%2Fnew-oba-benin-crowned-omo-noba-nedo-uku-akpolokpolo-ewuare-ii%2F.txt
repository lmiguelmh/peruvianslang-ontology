New Oba of Benin Crowned as Omo N’Oba N’Edo Uku’ Akpolokpolo Ewuare II
SIGNAL on October 20, 2016 at 7:18 pm
The newly crowned monarch of the ancient Benin Kingdom will be known as Omo N’Oba N’Edo Uku’ Akpolokpolo Ewuare II.
He unveiled his official title today at the presentation of staff  of office ceremony, which was attended by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and host governor, Adams Oshiomhole and Oba of Ife, Ooni Adeyeye Ogunwusi.
There was a secret coronation, however,  before the open ceremony.
NAN correspondent at the event said the crowning ceremony was performed at about 3.30 am today at Usama Palace, far from the prying eyes of cameras and press men.
It was witnessed by very close loyalists of the new king.
A  mammoth crowd later today escorted the new king  from Usama palace to Orho-Okpata in Benin.
The  crowd had waited patiently while chanting songs of praises and incantation before the King  came out exactly 1:05 pm and finally left the palace by 1:20 pm.
As it is the ritual, the Oba of Benin walked  through Oreogene and stopped by at Oloto palace, one of the seven Chiefs that performed the crowning ceremony at dawn.
The Oba  thereafter visited a shrine at Iwehen junction to pay homage.
Then he walked through Ibiwe and later arrived at Urho-Okpota where the crowning was officially performed by Chief Oliha of Benin.
Among the dignitaries were Iweghe, Iwebos, Ibiwe chiefs and youth, Ogbelaka chiefs, Isiemwenro guild, Ifieto, and Edigin N’Okakun.
The new monarch had relocated on Oct 11, to Usama palace to perform coronation rites, after spending three days at Urho-Okpota
