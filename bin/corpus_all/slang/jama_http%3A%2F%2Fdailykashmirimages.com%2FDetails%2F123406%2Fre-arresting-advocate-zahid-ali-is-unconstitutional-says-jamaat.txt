‘Forces in Valley created a war like situation’
Srinagar: Jama’at-e-Islami (JeI) Jammu and Kashmir on Tuesday vehemently denounced the re-arrest of its spokesperson Advocate Zahid Ali by police and termed it “undemocratic and unconstitutional”.
“Police and other forces in valley have created a war like situation and have detained thousands of youths including school going children,” Jama’at said in a statement.
 “Presently there are countless youth who have been detained by police under infamous law Public Safety Act and have been lodged in far flung prisons which is itself a brute violation of democratic norms,” Jama’at said.
“Similarly,” the statement said, “Advocate Zahid Ali, spokesperson of Jama’at, who is under police custody and is confined in sub-jail Kothibagh since 31 August 2016, was again taken into remand yesterday till 12 November, 2016. Government and its agencies are actually terrified from the status of Zahid Ali and it is why he is being entrapped under false and flimsy cases in order to prolong his detention.”
Jama’at vehemently denounced the “hostile behaviour of police towards innocent and defenseless” Kashmiris and urged all human rights bodies to “take effective and concrete measures for the safety and well-being of defenseless Kashmiris.”
