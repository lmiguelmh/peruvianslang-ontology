GWERU: Two men have been jailed to an effective 12 months each after being convicted for possessing six kilogrammes of marijuana.
Golden Khuleka, 25, and Frederick Shumba, 30, of Mkoba high density suburb had appeared before magistrate Tayengwa Chibanda facing charges of possessing dangerous drugs.
Khuleka was found in possession of 1,3kg of dagga while Shumba had 5kg of the drug when they were nabbed by police on patrol in the city centre.
Chibanda sentenced Khuleka to 24 months but suspended 12 months on condition of good behaviour while Shumba got 36 months with 24 months of the sentence set aside.
The duo told the court that they were taking the dagga to an unnamed well known Gokwe traditional healer whom they said was in the habit of buying and selling dagga.
Prosecutors told the court that on September 18, at around 1 AM, police constables Tshuma and Ndlovu were on patrol in the city centre.
As they got to Cathedral Hall they saw the two who suspiciously held their bags as they stood in a dark corner.
They searched the duo's bags and discovered the dagga.
