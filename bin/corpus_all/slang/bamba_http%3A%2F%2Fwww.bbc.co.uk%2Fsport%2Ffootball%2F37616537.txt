Cardiff City make defender Sol Bamba Neil Warnock's latest signing

Sol Bamba has played for Dumfermline, Hibernian, Trabzonspor, Palermo and Leeds
New Cardiff City boss Neil Warnock has made ex-Leeds United defender Sol Bamba his latest recruit.
Bamba, 31, has signed until 2018 and joins ex-QPR winger Junior Hoilett at the Bluebirds.
Ivory Coast international Bamba will help bolster a defence that has conceded 19 league goals this season to leave Cardiff 23rd in the Championship.
Striker Marouane Chamakh is also expected to join Cardiff before they host Bristol City on Friday.
Warnock told Cardiff's website: "I tried to sign Sol a few years ago when he was at Leicester, on a couple of occasions. They didn't come off then, but now is the right time and opportunity to bring him in.
"Sol's a leader and he's another good addition for us."

Bamba said: "I'm excited to be here. I always want to work with the gaffer, so as soon as this chance arose I jumped at it.
"I know the league very well and am looking forward to offering my experience and leadership."
Chamakh, a 32-year-old Moroccan who was released by Crystal Palace, had previously attracted interest from Bluebirds boss Warnock.
Centre-back Bamba left Leeds for personal reasons in September.
Bamba, Hoilett and Chamakh are set to be involved against Bristol City, which will be Warnock's first game since taking charge.
