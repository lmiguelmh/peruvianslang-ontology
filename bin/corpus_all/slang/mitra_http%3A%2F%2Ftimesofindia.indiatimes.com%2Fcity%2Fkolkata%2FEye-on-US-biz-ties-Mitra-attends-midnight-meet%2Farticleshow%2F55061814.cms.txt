It wasn't surprising that state finance and industries minister Amit Mitra spent one-and-a-half hours with the US India Business Council (USIBC), a little after Monday midnight, to be assured that a delegation will be in town from January 19 to 21 during Global Bengal Business Summit. The meeting, attended by USIBC president Mukesh Aghi, global CEO of MasterCard Ajay Banga, ambassador Frank Wisner, consul general of India in New York Riva Ganguly Das and 35 others, was held in New York. Along with Mitra, Trinamool MP and spokesperson Derek O'Brien pitched Bengal as the next global destination. While O'Brien was in New York, Mitra joined the meeting on video-conference from Kolkata.


Pointing out that at the macro-economic level, the growth of Bengal stood far above that of the rest of the country, the state finance minister cited four examples based on 2015-16 figures that showed that the state outpaced GVA growth nationally by 4.72%, industrial sector growth by 3.29%, agricultural sector growth by 4.45% and services sector growth by 4.79%. Mitra also claimed the state economy was at a more solid footing compared to that during the Left rule in 2010-11. The GSDP (at current prices) has doubled, fiscal deficit and revenue deficit has been brought down, and state's own taxes have doubled in four years. Plan expenditure has grown thrice and capital expenditure has grown by seven times. Physical infrastructure in the state had grown fourfold, he claimed.

"Changes in Bengal in the past five years have been palpable and terrific," said Ajay Banga, chairman emeritus of USIBC & global CEO of MasterCard. Banga, who was appointed by US President Barack Obama in the Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity, a key administration post tasked with working towards internet safety, is not knew to Bengal, or Kolkata. The IIM Ahmedabad alumnus worked at Nestle in Kolkata before joining Citibank and then became the president and CEO of MasterCard Worldwide.


"The 90-minute meeting was purposive. The Q&A session was also invigorating," O'Brien said later.

I am a huge fan of Mamata Banerjee''s work BUT until business extortion, syndicate extortion and land mafia subsides I cannot endorse businesses to come to West Bengal. They will be met with a rude surprise at the ground level - MLAs backed with thugs. Didi HAS to address this before asking for investments.
