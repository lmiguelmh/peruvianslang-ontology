Governor Jama blames court cases for delayed development projects
5 days ago, by Charles Ronald
Court cases have been identified by Garissa Governor Nathif Jama as a hurdle to the completion of various projects in the county.
Governor Jama regretted that a number of projects, which have been initiated by the county government, have been halted by legal injunctions against the county.
The governor said that a total of 27 cases have already been filed against his administration since he took office, thus slowing down his pace to ensure development.
Jama further said that Garissa was the only county which does not have a County Lands Board due to a court injunction from a resident in the county.
“Cases filed against the county government are to blame for a lag in development in the county. The many court cases facing my administration had slowed progress in the county,” he said. 
“My administration has however initiated numerous development projects despite the legal challenges the county is facing,” added Governor Jama who was speaking in Garissa town.
Govenor Jama is facing a case in court in which he is accused of failing to comply with procurement procedures when executing a contract with the Kenya Red Cross e-Plus for provision of ambulance services to the county.
