African Nomad: Am black, will travel
Christa Dee | 09 noviembre, 2016 07:30
OUT AND ABOUT: On the move couple Phaka Dludla and Singatha Hlazo have found a gap in the travel industry for young South Africans Pictures: BUBBLEGUMCLUB
''We believe exploring the world is something everyone should experience," say Singatha Hlazo and Phaka Dludla, founders of Travel Noba and Zulu Nomad respectively.

The couple each have their own travel agency, but they operate together, sharing the same goals. Working as a tag team, their shared mission is to encourage young black South Africans to make travelling a big part of their lifestyles, by creating travel experiences that provide a positive narrative of the African continent.
Hlazo started Travel Noba in September and Zulu Nomad was established by Dludla after her stay and love of Shanghai, China.
Hlazo and Dludla say they've experienced how disheartening it is to board a plane with only a smattering of black South Africans. They are convinced, however, that the barriers to travel can be overcome.
Some of the issues they have identified include that some people don't realise that they can actually afford to travel, and have not pursued the idea. They have also found that many are afraid to travel inter-nationally on their own.
 Hlazo said: "Added to this is the fact that the black community is expected to spend their money in a certain way.
"We want to dispel these ideas. This is evident in the way that advertising is targeted at different race groups based on perceived interests and spending patterns."
Dludla said: ''We have noticed that there wasn't much travel marketing and advertising aimed at black people.
''In general, travelling is directed at the people represented in the ads - usually not black people. It felt like an exclusion."
When Dludla returned to South Africa from China, she had caught the travel bug and kept on receiving compliments and requests for information on how to find the time and money to travel.
She soon became aware of the gap in the travel industry for young people.
 Dludla describes Zulu Nomad as a ''group travel experience movement" with the aim of challenging the way in which young South Africans think about travel - specifically targeting and correcting the wrong idea that travel is only available to a select few.
''Historically, travelling was a privilege which the majority of us didn't grow up with. Our parents could never afford to take us on trips around the world," she said. "Travelling is often the last thing on our minds when we start making an income."
When planning a trip, Zulu Nomad makes sure that their clients enjoy each destination to the fullest.
"We try and plan experiences that are about putting yourself out there, challenging yourself and your world view," she said.
"They include scuba diving with whale sharks in Tofo, Mozambique; paragliding over the Turkish Riviera in Fethiye; and sailing on boats around the Mediterranean."
Hlazo and Dludla say they're also working hard to dispel the ''dark continent" narrative that is still informing people's ideas about travelling in Africa.
The Zulu Nomad Afrika Experiences are about changing "our own perceptions of what Africa is, by exploring the continent one country at a time".
''The most beautiful moments during our recent Zulu Nomad Malawi Experience couldn't be captured on film," said Hlazo. ''The warm spirit of Malawi came across in our interactions with the people. You don't get this from a picture, you've got to be there." - bubblegumclub.co.za
